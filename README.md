# My Work

## Index page
Using parallax, achieving a body slide effect.
Used carousel for slide presentation gallery.
Added Page icon for the browser tab.
```html
<link rel="icon" href="images/first.jpeg">
```
Transparency sections for better looks.
Dropdown, tabbed menu navbar.
The dropdown directs to the section of the current page using `#id`.
Navigation bar stays fixed on top.

## GameMode page
Embeded glyphicon in the nav bar.
jumbotron used for heading. With CSS for positioning.
Extended bootstrap's grid system with thumbnail component.
Grid system testing.

### Community page
Experimented with the Media Objects.
And the pagination system.

### Issues
> Nav bar size changes somehow in GameMode.
> Current code needs clean up
> Unable to use parallax with video.
